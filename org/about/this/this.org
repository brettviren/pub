In which I give the requisite grandiloquent soliloquy about how this
site is made.

* Purpose and intent

This is another in a long line of attempts to put on the web various
bits of information I have written.

* Organization

Following Hugo nomenclature the site is organized first by /sections/:

- [[file:/about/][about]] :: meta descriptions (ie, this page),
- [[file:/posts/][posts]] :: blog entries unlikely to see updates,
- [[file:/articles/][articles]] :: long form on a topic and potentially updated over time.

All /pages/ in these sections may have one or more /category/ or /tag/.  In
Hugo these are both /taxonomies/.  They are provided by Hugo with no
assumed interpretation and so these are taken:

- [[file:/categories/][categories]] :: limited number of general descriptors defined in a top-down manner
- [[file:/tags/][tags]] :: numerous, unbound set of detailed descriptors defined in a bottom-up manner as pages are written. 

* Tech

This blog uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] with [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] to make content for
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]].  See [[file:/articles/howido][howido]] if interested in details of my personal computing
configuration.
